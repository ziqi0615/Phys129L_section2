Among them, the fastest is Quickhull, followed by Graham Scan, Monotone Chain, and finally Jarvis March, which is the slowest.

The trend of time complexity and the relative efficiency of the different algorithms remain consistent, regardless of changes in the spread of the point cloud.

All of the algorithms exhibit a distribution that is largely bell-shaped, with a skew toward lower values. However, their distributions are still a little bit different
